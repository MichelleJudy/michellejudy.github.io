    ðŸŒ¿ Hi, Iâ€™m Michelle. I go by the writer name Michelle Judy. Iâ€™m an educator,
    an eternal student, and a quiet believer in the power of words.
  </p>

  <p>
    I hold a degree in English Literature, and Iâ€™m ECCEd and TEFL certified,
    with a special focus on Positive Psychology. As a practicing teacher, I
    offer private classes in English, ELA, public speaking, and creative writing
    â€” spaces where learning goes beyond grammar and enters the realm of
    expression, clarity, and growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Iâ€™m also the author of Blessed In The Mess â€” a collection of 21 sonnets that
    explore grace through chaos. This book was honored with the prestigious 21st
    Century Emily Dickinson Award, and remains one of the most personal pieces
    of my creative journey.
  </p>

  <p>
    But at my core, Iâ€™m a storyteller and a seeker â€” someone who believes that
    teaching, writing, and wandering inward are all forms of service.
  </p>

  <h3>âœ¨ My Why</h3>
  <p>
    I believe that awareness is the beginning of all transformation. That
    gratitude isnâ€™t an act â€” itâ€™s an attitude. And that when we slow down enough
    to notice, we begin to change â€” from the inside out.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through these blogs, voice-led reflections, and soft storytelling, I hope to
    offer what Iâ€™ve always needed:

    <ul>
      <li>A companion on the path.</li>
      <li>A pause in the noise.</li>
      <li>A reflection worth sitting with.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    In a world where advice often feels hollow and superficial, this is a call
    to the wanderers. To those who want more than just quick answers. To those
    who feel deeply and grow quietly. To those who are ready to go inward,
    before they go outward.
  </p>

  <p>If thatâ€™s you â€” welcome home.</p>
