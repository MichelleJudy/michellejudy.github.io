      <h4>Thoughts to grow by.</h4>

      <p>
        Welcome, wanderer.<br />I’m so glad you’re here.<br /><br />Rooted
        Reflections is a quiet corner on the internet — a space to slow down,
        breathe a little deeper, and come home to yourself. Through words,
        voice, and story, I explore the themes of awareness, gratitude,
        identity, and slow, soul-rooted growth.<br /><br />Each week, you’ll
        find:<br /><br />📚 Two blog posts that reflect on the deeper things we
        often overlook<br />🎙️ One podcast episode that brings those ideas to
        life in a voice-led format<br />📱 Voiceover reels that offer gentle
        reminders and reflections throughout your week.<br /><br />This space
        isn’t about quick fixes or forced positivity. It’s about noticing.
        Wandering. Growing at your own pace. Because sometimes, the smallest
        shifts create the most meaningful change.
