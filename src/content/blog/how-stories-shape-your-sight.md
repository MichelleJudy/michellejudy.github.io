## _How Stories Shape Your Sight_

**Theme:** Becoming aware of the narratives we’ve internalized — and how they filter the way we see ourselves, others, and the world.

---

### **Reflective Questions:**

> What stories are you carrying without even realizing it?
>
> “I’m the fixer.”
> “I always get left behind.”
> “Good things don’t happen to people like me.”
>
> Where did those stories come from?
>
> What if awareness isn’t just about noticing what’s happening —
> but noticing _the story you’re telling yourself about it?_
>
> And what if, little by little, you could choose to tell a different one?

### _“And here’s the part where my brain takes a stroll. Let’s wander together.”_

### **Introduction:**

We are storytelling creatures.
From the moment we could speak, we’ve been weaving meaning —
around events, experiences, relationships, and even our own worth.

Stories are how we make sense of the world.
But over time, some stories we picked up without questioning.
And some became so familiar, we forgot they were optional.

Awareness invites us to notice the lens through which we live.

### **The Unseen Narratives We Live By**

There are stories you’ve been carrying that shape everything:

- How you interpret success.

- How you define failure.

- How you measure love, belonging, or enoughness.


They often start quietly: a comment from a teacher, a feeling from childhood, a belief passed down without question.
But once internalized, they become the lens you look through — without even realizing it.

### **How Stories Shape Awareness**

Your stories filter your experiences.
Two people can live the same moment — and experience it completely differently based on the story they’re bringing to it.

If your story says, “I’m not worthy,”
you’ll interpret neutral moments as rejection.

If your story says, “People always leave,”
you’ll see distance even when none is meant.

Becoming aware of your story is the first step in loosening its grip.
You can't change what you're not willing to see.

### **The Gentle Art of Retelling**

You don’t have to bulldoze your old stories.
You can retell them — slowly, kindly, truthfully.

Start by noticing:

- What old narrative is surfacing here?

- Is it fully true — or partly a memory?

- What might a new, kinder story sound like?


Maybe “I always mess things up” becomes
“I’m learning through every step.”

Maybe “I’m too much” becomes
“My depth is my strength.”

The goal isn’t to erase the past — it’s to reclaim the lens you live through.

---

### **Closing Reflection:**

You are the storyteller, not just the story.
You have the power to choose what you carry forward.
What you honor.
What you rewrite.

Awareness is the first turn of the page.

### ✨ **Until our next stroll, here’s something for you to hold:**

_You don’t have to live inside an old story forever.
You can notice, question, and gently begin a new one._

### **Closing Signature:**

**Thanks for wandering with me. Until our next stroll, keep wandering, keep wondering.**
