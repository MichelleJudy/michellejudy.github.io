## Who’s Really Speaking in Your Head?

**Theme:** Noticing inner voices, questioning internal narratives, awakening to what’s yours and what’s been borrowed.

---

### **Reflective Questions:**

> Do you ever catch yourself mid-thought and wonder —
> _“Wait… where did that even come from?”_
>
> That inner voice — the one that says you’re not good enough, not ready, too much, or not enough —
> Whose voice is that, really?
>
> Is it yours?
> Or is it something you’ve picked up over the years —
> a blend of past critiques, old labels, casual comments, or outdated beliefs that somehow stuck?
>
> **What would happen if you paused… and questioned it?**

### _“And here’s the part where my brain takes a stroll. Let’s wander together.”_

---

### **Introduction:**

We all have an inner narrator.
Sometimes it's kind. Encouraging. Wise.
But more often than we’d like to admit, it’s critical, harsh, and reactive —
sounding suspiciously like voices we’ve heard before:
a parent, a teacher, a boss, an old friend, a cultural script.

Awareness begins when we recognize this voice not as a truth teller,
but as a story on repeat.
And then — gently — we ask:
**Is this really me? Or just something I’ve believed for too long?**

---

### **The Inner Echo**

Most of us never question our thoughts.
We hear them, and we assume they’re _us_.
But your inner voice is often an echo —
a reflection of past experiences that got internalized.

Maybe you were told to “stop being so sensitive,”
so now every time you feel something deeply,
you shame yourself for it.

Or maybe you once heard, “You’re too slow,”
and now, every pause feels like failure.

These aren’t your truths.
They’re unexamined echoes.

### **Naming the Narrator**

One of the most powerful things you can do is _name the voice._
Not to label or judge — but to create space between you and it.
Ask yourself:

- Where did I first hear this?

- Who told me this mattered?

- Is this helping me grow, or keeping me small?


Awareness allows you to gently step back and observe:
Ah, this is the voice of comparison.
This is the voice of fear.
This is the voice of 15-year-old me, still trying to belong.

You are not the voice.
You are the listener.

---

### **Choosing a New Soundtrack**

Once you recognize the borrowed voices,
you get to choose what stays.
You get to rewrite the tone of your inner world.

You might start with simple phrases:

- “That’s not mine to carry.”

- “This thought doesn’t define me.”

- “I’m still learning — and that’s okay.”


The goal isn’t to silence your thoughts.
It’s to filter them with awareness and kindness.

---

### **Closing Reflection:**

Your inner world has been shaped by many hands, many moments, many voices.
But the more you notice, the more power you reclaim.
You get to be the author now.
You get to decide which voices are worth listening to — and which ones are long overdue for release.

---

### ✨ **Until our next stroll, here’s something for you to hold:**

_You are not the voice in your head.
You are the one who gets to choose which voice gets the mic._

---

### **Closing Signature:**

**Thanks for wandering with me. Until our next stroll, keep wandering, keep wondering.**
